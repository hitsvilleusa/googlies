Easily add googly eyes to your web page.  Just do the following:

1) Include the googlies.js file.
2) Add a canvas element to your page somewhere and give it an id.
3) Add a javascript call like: new Googlies('element_id');

That's it!

If you need help, please feel free to email me.  I can make the code nicer, and the readme better if there is demand.

Enjoy!
